# Quick fixes

- [x] Practice Guide link has a double "> >"
- [x] Chip color scheme isn't consistent across screens (mele is sometimes green, sometimes violet)
- [x] Test data should be real oli or mele, not fake songs with fake Olelo
- [x] Repertoire screen should say Repertoire at the top, not Haumana
- [x] Update dev.herman.haumana.* to app.haumana.*
- [x] Drop Pearl Hirenha font from bundle

# Blocking 1.0 release

- [ ] Practice landscape side-by-side view shouldn't independently scroll two languages
- [ ] Practice landscape side-by-side translation doesn't wrap around the X
- [ ] Practice landscape side-by-side translation spills down onto overflow but grey background doesn't
- [ ] Empty state:
  - [ ] no search on repertoire page
  - [ ] no stats on practice page
  - [ ] styling of repertoire page and practice page are inconsistent. Maybe lehua flower on both?
  - [ ] go to repertoire page button doesn't do what it says

# Polish (nice-to-haves)

- [ ] Collapse repeated practice sessions
- [ ] VoiceOver carousel navigation doesn't scroll the carousel, so it gets confused about the gestures when going back left
- [ ] Maybe each title should be in Pearl Hirenha font
