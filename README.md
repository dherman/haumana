### Acknowledgments

I built this app to help my family and friends in the Bay Area hula community with their practice routines. It's created in the spirit of respect and aloha for Hawaiian cultural practitioners and I hope it may be of use to anyone in the community. This app is my own and does not claim to represent any hālau or organization; any mistakes or missteps are my own, and I welcome feedback and suggestions.

Special thanks to the Bay Area hula community, especially hālau [Nā Lei Hulu i ka Wēkiu](https://naleihulu.org/), for their many years of making art and spreading beauty and aloha. Again, this app is my own and does not claim to represent any hālau or organization.
