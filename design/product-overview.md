# Haumana ðŸŒº

**Haumana** is an iOS app to help students of Hawaiian art and culture to manage practice routines.

## Intended users

- My initial intended user is my daughter, who is a middle school student studying hula, oli, and mele. She currently practices her oli every day. As here repertoire grows, my hope is that it will help make it easier for her to decide each day which piece she wants to practice, and help her with her goal of not just learning new pieces but keeping all of her pieces fresh in her memory.
- If it is successful, I would expect the app to be useful for all ages, children and adults.

## Principles

- This app is meant to be a tool that's helpful for a student of Hawaiian cultural practices. The focus is on the student and the culture, not the app. The app should serve the student, never the other way around. All app UX should present with humility.
- I have no interest whatsoever in making any money off this app, so there will never be ads or in-app purchases.
- Because students of Hawaiian culture are often children, this app takes privacy and online safety very seriously. The only user data I will store will be the bare minimum required to support a student's study goals, and for children under 13, it will require parental consent. If I ever add sharing functionality, it will be very limited and only for the purpose of serving a student's goals. This will not be a social media app.
