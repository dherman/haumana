# Setup Decision Guide

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you have Google OAuth credentials ready?
├─ NO → Create them first in Google Cloud Console
└─ YES → Continue
    │
    ├─ Is this for learning AWS services?
    │  └─ YES → Use Manual Setup (follow COGNITO_SETUP.md)
    │
    ├─ Is this a one-time prototype?
    │  └─ YES → Either approach works (Manual is fine)
    │
    └─ Is this for production or multiple environments?
       └─ YES → Use CDK (follow cdk/README.md)
```

## Setup Time Estimates

| Approach | Time | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| CDK | 25 minutes | Production, Teams, Multiple Environments |
| Manual | 2-4 hours | Learning, Single Prototype |
| Hybrid | 1 hour | CDK for most, manual for fine-tuning |

## Checklist: Choose CDK If...

- [ ] You want repeatable deployments
- [ ] You have multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] You work in a team
- [ ] You value infrastructure as code
- [ ] You want built-in best practices
- [ ] You need easy rollback capability
- [ ] You want to avoid manual errors

## Checklist: Choose Manual If...

- [ ] You're learning AWS services
- [ ] You need very specific custom configuration
- [ ] Your organization prohibits IaC tools
- [ ] You're building a one-off prototype
- [ ] You want to understand every setting

## Hybrid Approach

You can also combine both:

1. Use CDK to deploy base infrastructure
2. Make minor adjustments in console
3. Document any manual changes

## Migration Strategy

### From Manual to CDK:
1. Deploy CDK to new environment first
2. Test thoroughly
3. Migrate data using AWS tools
4. Switch DNS/endpoints
5. Decommission old resources

### From CDK to Different Region:
```bash
# Just change the region and deploy
cdk deploy --region us-east-1
```

## Cost Considerations

Both approaches create the same resources, but:

- **CDK**: Easier to tear down (no forgotten resources)
- **Manual**: Risk of orphaned resources costing money
- **CDK**: Better resource tagging for cost allocation

## Team Considerations

### For Solo Developers:
- Either approach works
- CDK saves time long-term

### For Teams:
- CDK is strongly recommended
- Enables code reviews for infrastructure
- Consistent environments for all developers

## Final Recommendation

**Start with CDK** unless you have a specific reason not to. You can always look at the manual setup guides to understand what CDK is doing behind the scenes.

The 25-minute CDK deployment gives you the same result as 2-4 hours of manual clicking, with better consistency and fewer errors.
